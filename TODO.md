Remaining Items for GAVERSNATCH

I want to feel better about this project.

What isn't feeling good about it right now?
- It isn't really a game right now.
- I feel like it's ugly. 
- It isn't as far along as I would like it to be. 
- I don't like the theming. 
- It feels like stuff is taking too long. 


What would be the next right thing to do? 
- Research some prompt engineering with Google Gemini to get some unique rooms. 
    - Have the AI write the JSON object that is being sent to the server. 
- Aim to have the player move around into unique rooms. 
- Get the styling feeling better.
